# Learning Python

Welcome to my Python learning journey! This repository is dedicated to documenting my progress as I learn and practice Python. Here, you will find study materials, exercises, examples, and projects that I have worked on to improve my Python skills. I will be updating this repository regularly as I cover new topics and complete new projects.

## Repository Structure

- `00-Introduction`: Basic concepts and environment setup. This section includes my initial notes and exercises on getting started with Python.
- `01-Basic-Syntax`: Fundamentals of Python syntax. Here, I will be exploring the basic building blocks of Python.
- `02-OOP`: Object-Oriented Programming. This section will delve into OOP concepts, with examples and exercises to reinforce learning.
- `03-Projects`: Practical projects to apply what I've learned. As I complete more projects, I will add them here to showcase my skills.
- `resources`: Additional resources like books, video tutorials, and useful links. I will keep adding valuable resources that I find helpful in my learning journey.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/learning-python.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the desired folder and follow the instructions in each section.

## Development Progress

### 00-Introduction
- **Status:** On progess
- **Contents:** Basic concepts about Python, installation instructions, and environment setup.

### 01-Basic-Syntax
- **Status:** Planned
- **Contents:** Notes on variables, data types, control structures (if statements, loops), and basic functions. Exercises and example scripts to practice syntax.

### 02-OOP
- **Status:** Planned
- **Contents:** This section will cover classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. I will add notes, exercises, and example scripts.

### 03-Projects
- **Status:** Planned
- **Contents:** Here, I will apply what I've learned by working on practical projects. Each project will have its own subfolder with a README explaining the project's objectives and how to run it.

### resources
- **Status:** Ongoing
- **Contents:** A collection of useful resources including books, video tutorials, and links to websites. I will update this section with new resources as I find them.

## Future Plans

- Continue expanding each section with more detailed notes and exercises.
- Complete and add more projects to the `03-Projects` folder.
- Regularly update the `resources` folder with new and useful learning materials.

Happy learning!
